            <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a></h3>
            <p>This is the site of the classic fast-food giant Mcdonald's</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><u>Contrast:</u> The website uses striking contrasts, like red and yellow against lighter backgrounds, to draw attention to important parts like headlines and specials. This not only looks good but also makes the site easier to navigate.</li>
                <li><u>Repetition:</u> The McDonald's website uses the same fonts, colors, and design elements throughout. This consistent style helps with brand recognition and makes the site more user-friendly, as everything feels familiar and easy to understand.</li>
                <li><u>Alignment:</u> Everything on the McDonald's website, including text, images, and buttons, is neatly aligned. This creates a tidy look, making the site visually appealing and easy to use.</li>
                <li><u>Proximity:</u> The McDonald's website smartly groups similar items, like menu options and deals, making it easy to navigate and quickly find what you're looking for.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.soldelishrestaurant.com/">Sol'Delish</a></h3>
            <p>A local restaurant in the Charlotte area specializing in soul food</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><u>Contrast:</u> The design of the logos and icons lacks sufficient contrast. This issue makes it challenging to differentiate between clickable and non-clickable elements.</li>
                <li><u>Repetition:</u> In the sub-menus, a uniform design is not consistently applied, leading to a lack of repetition. This inconsistency hinders users' ability to easily recognize and understand the content.</li>
                <li><u>Alignment:</u> The main content of the page and the footer content are not aligned, resulting in a disjointed block presence. This misalignment leaves the website's overall appearance jarring and uncoordinated.</li>
                <li><u>Proximity:</u> The website fails to effectively utilize proximity in its layout, causing related elements to appear disconnected and scattered. This poor implementation of proximity makes the site's navigation and content comprehension unnecessarily challenging for users.</li>
            </ul>
